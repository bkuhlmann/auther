= Auther

Auther provides simple, form-based authentication for apps that need security but don't want to deal
with the clunky HTTP Basic Authentication user interface or as heavyweight as
link:https://github.com/plataformatec/devise[Devise]. Auther doesn't require a database and is
compatible with password managers which makes for a pleasant user experience.

Auther is useful in situations -- like minimal viable products or applications with a small user
base -- where you need to a security layer up and running quickly before adding more robust user
management.

== Features

* Uses CSS Flexbox for lightweight styling.
* Uses encrypted account credentials to keep sensitive information secure.
* Supports multiple accounts with optional path exclude lists.
* Supports customizable routes, models, presenters, views, controllers, and loggers.
* Provides a generator for easy install and setup within an existing project.
* Provides auto-redirection to requested path for verified credentials.

== Requirements

. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby]
. link:https://rubyonrails.org[Ruby on Rails]

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install auther
----

Add the following to your Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "auther"
----

Run the install generator to configure and initialize your application:

[source,bash]
----
rails generate auther:install
----

Run the credentials generator to generate credentials for your application:

[source,bash]
----
rails generate auther:credentials
----

If using link:https://direnv.net[direnv], for example, you can copy and paste the generated
credentials into your `.envrc` file. Example:

image::https://alchemists.io/images/projects/auther/screenshots/credentials_generator.jpg[Credentials Generator Screenshot]

== Usage

Launch your Rails application and visit the following: `http://localhost:3000/login`. Enter your
login and password as used for the `rails generate auther:credentials` generator and you'll be
logged in.

=== Initializer

The initializer (installed during setup) can be found here: `config/initializers/auther.rb`. The
initializer comes installed with the following settings:

[source,ruby]
----
Rails.application.config.auther_settings = {
  accounts: [
    {
      name: "admin",
      encrypted_login: ENV["AUTHER_ADMIN_LOGIN"],
      encrypted_password: ENV["AUTHER_ADMIN_PASSWORD"],
      paths: ["/admin"]
    }
  ],
  secret: ENV["AUTHER_SECRET"]
}
----

To encrypt/decrypt account credentials, launch a rails console and run the following:

[source,ruby]
----
# The secret as defined in `auther_settings` and/or produced by the credentials generator.
secret = SecureRandom.hex 16 # "426a7f46548a1a4518676a8e246517d8"

# The cipher for encrypting/decrypting values.
cipher = Auther::Cipher.new secret

# Use the following to encrypt an unencrypted value.
cipher.encrypt "test@test.com"

# Use the following to decrypt an encrypted value.
cipher.decrypt "hWToltdpl+uZJBPELKNC7Ij++jPkTuo=--nEdbOYL9fIRh14hY--fU+VSCd4+DDOhOmG1gzRfQ=="
----

The initializer can be customized as follows:

* `title` - Optional. The HTML page title (as rendered within a browser tab). Default:
  `"Authorization"`.
* `label` - Optional. The page label (what would appear above the form). Default: `"Authorization"`.
* `secret` - Required. The secret passphrase used to encrypt/decrypt account credentials.
* `accounts` - Required. The array of accounts with different or similar access to the application.
** `name` - Required. The account name that uniquely identifies the account.
** `encrypted_login` - Required. The encrypted account login.
** `encrypted_password` - Required. The encrypted account password.
** `paths` - Required. The array of excluded paths for which only this account has access to.
** `authorized_url` - Optional. The URL to redirect to upon successful authorization. Authorized
    redirection works in the order defined:
*** The excluded path (if requested prior to authorization but now authorized).
*** The authorized URL (if defined and the excluded path wasn't requested).
*** The root path (if none of the above).
** `deauthorized_url` - Optional. The URL to redirect to upon successful deauthorization (i.e.
    logout). Deauthorized redirections works as follows (in the order defined):
*** The deauthorized URL (if defined).
*** The auth URL.
* `url` - Optional. The URL to redirect to when enforcing authentication. Default: `"/login"`.
* `logger` - Optional. The logger used to log path/account authorization messages. Default:
  `Auther::NullLogger`.

=== Routes

The routes can be customized as follows (installed, by default, via the install generator):

[source,ruby]
----
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Auther::Engine => "/auther"
  get "/login", to: "auther/session#new", as: "login"
  delete "/logout", to: "auther/session#destroy", as: "logout"
end
----

=== Model

The `Auther::Account` is a struct that uses ActiveModel validations to aid in attribute validation.
This model could potentially be replaced with a database-backed object (would require controller
customization)...but you should question if you have outgrown the use of this gem and need a
different solution altogether if it comes to that.

=== Presenter

The `Auther::Presenter::Account` is a plain old Ruby object that uses ActiveModel validations to aid
in form validation. This presenter makes it easy to construct form data for input and validation.

=== View

The view can be customized by creating the following file within your Rails application (assumes
that the default `Auther::SessionController` implementation is sufficient):
`app/views/auther/session/new.html`.

The form uses the `@account` instance variable which is an instance of the
`Auther::Presenter::Account` presenter (as mentioned above). The form can be stylized by modifying
the styles found in the `auther.scss` stylesheet.

=== Controller

The `Auther::SessionController` inherits from the `Auther::BaseController`. To customize, it is
recommended that you add a controller to your app that inherits from the `Auther::BaseController`.
Example:

[source,ruby]
----
# Example Path:  app/controllers/session_controller.rb
class SessionController < Auther::BaseController
  layout "example"
end
----

This allows customization of session controller behavior to serve any special business needs. See
the `Auther::BaseController` for additional details or the `Auther::SessionController` for default
implementation.

=== Logging

As mentioned in the setup above, the logger can be customized as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
# This is the default logger silences all logging attempts.
Auther::NullLogger.new

# Can be used to log to the environment log.
ActiveSupport::Logger.new "log/#{Rails.env}.log"

# Can be used to log to standard output.
Logger.new STDOUT
----

When logging is enabled, you'll be able to see the following information in the server logs to help
debug custom Auther settings:

* Requested path and excluded path detection.
* Finding (or not finding) of account.
* Account authentication pass/fail.
* Account and path authorization pass/fail.

=== Troubleshooting

* If upgrading Rails, changing the cookie/session settings, generating a new secret base key, etc.
  this might cause Auther authentication to fail. Make sure to clear your browser cookies in this
  situation or use Google Chrome (incognito mode) to verify.
* If the authentication view/form looks broken (stylewise) this could be due to custom
  `ActionView::Base.field_error_proc` settings defined by your app (usually via an initializer).
  Auther uses this configuration `ActionView::Base.field_error_proc = proc { |html_tag, _|
  html_tag.html_safe }` so that no additional markup is added to the DOM when errors are raised. If
  you have customized this to something else, you might want to read the usage documentation
  (mentioned above) to rebuild the authentication view/form for your specific business needs.
